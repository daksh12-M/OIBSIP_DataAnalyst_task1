# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task1

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on two different datasets to extract useful business insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `first.ipynb` → Sales data analysis (from `sales_data_sample.csv`)  
- `second.ipynb` → Menu data analysis (from `menu.csv`)  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported and cleaned raw datasets.  
2. Handled missing values and reformatted columns.  
3. Performed summary statistics and exploratory visualizations.  
4. Extracted key patterns in sales and menu datasets.  
5. Generated actionable recommendations.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📊 Outcomes
- **Sales Dataset Insights**:  
  - November shows peak sales → optimize Q4 inventory.  
  - Focus on medium/large deal sizes for better revenue.  
  - Customer loyalty programs should target high purchase history customers.  

- **Menu Dataset Insights**:
